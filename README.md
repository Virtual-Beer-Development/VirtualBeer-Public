# About Us âœ¨
What are we? We are whats called the BarBot Development Team. Originally found by Alexyy#7777, Where we have made our first discord bot called "BarBot". We then expanded quite quick and gotten around 100 servers within 1 month. After the verification has failed and we could not possibly continue to work on barbot, We decided to make a new and better discord bot called "Virtual Beer".
